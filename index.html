            Rainfall is highly variable in time and space. Over 75% of the annual rainfall is received in the four rainy months of June to September only thereby leading to large variations on temporal scale. The average annual rainfall is 119 cm, but it has great spatial variations. The areas on the Western Ghats and the Sub-Himalayan areas in North East and Meghalaya Hills receive heavy rainfall of over 250 cm annually, whereas the Areas of Northern parts of Kashmir and Western Rajasthan receive rainfall less than 40 cm.
